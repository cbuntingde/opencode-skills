## What I do

- Scan codebases for common anti-patterns and legacy code smells

- Generate refactoring tickets with before/after code comparisons

## When to use me

Use this skill when:

- Preparing a refactoring sprint and need to identify high-impact targets
- Reviewing code quality and need objective metrics on technical debt
- Writing documentation for why refactoring is necessary
- Planning code modernization initiatives
