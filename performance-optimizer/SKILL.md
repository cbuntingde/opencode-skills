## What I do
- Analyze code for performance bottlenecks (N+1 queries, unnecessary iterations, blocking I/O)
- Profile critical paths to identify slow operations
- Suggest and implement caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and ORM usage
- Identify memory leaks and excessive allocations
- Recommend algorithmic improvements
- Apply async/parallel processing where beneficial

## When to use me
Use this skill when:
- Application response times are degrading
- Database query counts are too high
- Memory usage is growing unbounded
- CPU utilization is unexpectedly high
- Preparing for scale or high-traffic events
- After adding new features that may impact performance
