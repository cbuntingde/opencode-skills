## What I do

I guide a systematic transformation from user intent to working code through these phases:

1. **Intent Analysis** - Clarify requirements, identify constraints, surface ambiguities
2. **Architecture Design** - Choose patterns, define components, plan data flow
3. **Implementation Planning** - Break into tasks, estimate complexity, sequence work
4. **Code Generation** - Write idiomatic code following project conventions
5. **Verification** - Run tests, linting, type checks; validate functionality

## When to use me

Use this skill when:
- A feature request is vague or incomplete
- You need to break down complex functionality into manageable steps
- You want structured guidance from concept to implementation
- Multiple iterations are needed to refine the solution

## Usage

Invoke this skill at the start of feature work. I'll:
- Ask clarifying questions about requirements
- Propose an architecture and implementation plan
- Generate code in focused, reviewable chunks
- Verify each piece works before moving on

## Pipeline Output

Each pipeline produces:
- Requirements checklist
- Component diagram/data flow
- Task list with dependencies
- Implementation files
- Test coverage summary
