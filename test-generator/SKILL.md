## What I do
- Analyze source code to identify testable units (functions, classes, modules)
- Generate unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests based on code structure
- Create mock objects and stubs for external dependencies
- Implement test cases covering happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Support multiple testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, pytest, JUnit, etc.)

## When to use me
Use this skill when:
- Starting a new project and need test scaffolding
- Adding tests to legacy code without existing test coverage
- Expanding test coverage for critical paths
- Automating test creation during feature development
- Generating baseline tests for code review

## How I work
1. Scan target code to identify testable functions/methods
2. Analyze parameters, return types, and dependencies
3. Generate appropriate test templates with framework-specific syntax
4. Create mock configurations for external services
5. Output ready-to-run test files in the project's test directory
